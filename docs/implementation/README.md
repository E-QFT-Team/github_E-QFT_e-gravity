# Implementation Documentation

This directory contains detailed technical documentation about the implementation of various components in the E-QFT E-Gravity framework.

## Core Components

- SNR-based adaptive filtering

### 3. [Spin Implementation](spin_implementation.md)
Implementation of spin degrees of freedom:
- SU(2) spin initialization
- L^(-3/2) lattice renormalization
- Spin-curvature coupling
- Spin drift monitoring

### 4. [FFT vs Direct Overlap](fft_vs_overlap_implementation.md)
Comparison and implementation details of two approaches:
